# python-challenge - Python Homework Unit 3

## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

####I was tasks to create a Python script in Jupyter notebook to analyze the schoole records.
* Create a report that summarizes the district data.  
* Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
* Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that presents the bottom 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on the type of school (district or charter)

## Py School Analysis Conclusions
#### Money Spent Versus Overall Passing Rate<br>
While the logical conclusion might be that more funds spent on the education of a student would result in a higher passing percentage rate.  However, the scores for Spending per student analysis prove this to be a false conclusion.<br>  This analysis shows that money is not necessarily an indication of the overall passing rate percentage.  The highest overall passing percentage rate occurred with the schools that spent the lesser amounts of money per student with an average spending amount of less than $621 per student versus the other schools spending greater 19 per student.


#### Charter versus Public District Schools Overall Passing Rate<br>
In the analysis comparing the Charter versus District school’s overall passing rate, the charter school has a significantly higher rate at 95 percent versus the district school’s 74 percent. Although the teacher-to-student ratio is not available for this analysis and could add more overall context.

#### Overall, there needs to be additional analysis to examine more metrics around improving the performance of the lower-performing schools. How can the processes and procedures of the top schools be replicated at the lower performing schools to improve the math and reading abilities of these students?
