## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

I was tasks to create a Python script in Jupyter notebook to analyze the schoole records.
* Create a report that summarizes the district data.  
* Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
* Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that presents the the bottom 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter)

Below are the results of this analysis:

## Py School Analysis Conclusions
#### Money Spent Versus Overall Passing Rate<br>
While the logical conclusion might be that the more funds spent for the education of a student would result in a higher passing percentage rate.  However, the scores for Spending per student analysis proves this to be a false conclusion.<br>  This analysis shows that money is not necessarily an indication of the overall passing rate percentage.  The highest overall passing percentage rate occured with the schools who spent the lessor amounts of money per student with an average spend amount of less tha $621 per student versus the other schools spending greater 19 per student.


#### Charter versus Public Distric Schools Overall Passing Rate<br>
In the analysis comparing the Charter versus District schools overall passing rate, the charter school has a significatly higher rate at 95 percent versus the district schools 74 percent. Although the teacher to student ratio is not available for this analysis and could add more overall context.
