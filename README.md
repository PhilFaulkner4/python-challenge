## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

I was tasks to create a Python script in Jupyter notebook to analyze the schoole records.
* Create a report that summarizes the district data.  
* Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
* Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that presents the the bottom 5 performing schools based on the Overall Passing percentage.
* Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
* Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter)

Below are the results of this analysis:
