# python-challenge - Python Homework Unit 3

## PyBank Instructions

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

**** 

4.	### Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
5.	* The total number of months included in the dataset

6.	* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

7.	* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
8.	* The_greatest_increase_in_profits (date and amount) over the entire period

9.	* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
